# Descriptive Report of the Practice

## Problem Definition

_Briefly describe the problem to be solved. You may add images from the dataset to show examples (see the final note to learn how to insert images)._

## Added Feature Extractors

_Describe the extractors you have added. If you have implemented more than one, use a sub-section (###) for each of them._

## Experiments and Analysis of Results

_This section describes the experiments and the results obtained. If you have worked with more than one classifier, you may organize the content with a sub-section for each one._  
_You must use tables and plots (for example, “acc” versus hyperparameter k of K-NN) to present the results. Remember that the metric we will use for comparison is “accuracy”, but you may also use others such as class-wise RR and average RR. You may also study, for example, which classes are most frequently confused and with which ones, showing the confusion matrix._

## Conclusions

_Highlight which model performs best and, if you have uploaded test predictions to Kaggle, include here the obtained score and the position of your model in the ranking._

**Note**: To insert images of tables or plots created with PowerPoint or LibreOffice, place them in the folder and use this code to display them:

  <img
    src="path/to/your/image.jpg"
    alt="Descriptive alternative text"
    width="400"
    height="300"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Caption: Describe your image here and its context (example: 'My Dog in the
    Park').
